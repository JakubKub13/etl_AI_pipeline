Weatherstack API Documentation
Welcome to the weatherstack API documentation. Using the instructions and interactive code examples below you will be able to start making API requests in a matter of minutes. If you have an account already and prefer to skip our detailed documentation, you can also jump to our 3-Step Quickstart Guide right away.

The weatherstack API was built to deliver accurate weather data for any application and use case, from real-time and historical weather information all the way to 14-day weather forecasts, supporting all major programming languages. Our straightforward API design will make it easy to use the API â€” continue reading below to get started.

Getting Started
API Authentication
The first step to using the API is to authenticate with your weatherstack account's unique API access key, which can be found in your account dashboard after registration. To authenticate with the API, simply use the base URL below and pass your API access key to the API's access_key parameter.

Example API Request:

Run API Requesthttp://api.weatherstack.com/current
    ? access_key = 5ddcce51c18222d01a9b226003cec35d
    & query = New York

Keep it safe: Please make sure to keep your API access key and do not expose it in any publicly available part of your application. If you ever want to reset your key, simply head over to your account dashboard to do so.

256-bit HTTPS EncryptionAvailable on: Standard Plan and higher
Clients using the Standard Plan or higher can connect to the weatherstack using industry-standard SSL (HTTPS) by attaching an s to the HTTP protocol as shown in the example API request below.

Example API Request:

https://api.weatherstack.com/...

If you are currently on the Free Plan and would like to use the HTTPS API in production, please upgrade your account now. You can also learn more about available plans on our Pricing Overview.

API Error Codes
Whenever an API request fails, the weatherstack API will return an error object in lightweight JSON format. Each error object contains an error code, an error type and an info object containing details about the error that occurred. Below you will find an example error as well as a list of common API errors.

Location Lookup/AutocompleteAvailable on: Standard Plan and higher
The weatherstack API's location autocomplete endpoint can be used to pinpoint one or more specific locations and their identifying response objects with the aim of later passing them to a weather data endpoint. In our example below, we are looking for London, United Kingdom.

Example API Request:

Run API Requesthttp://api.weatherstack.com/autocomplete
    ? access_key = 5ddcce51c18222d01a9b226003cec35d
    & query = london

HTTP GET Request Parameters:

access_key	[Required] Your API access key, which can be found in your acccount dashboard.
query	[Required] Use this parameter to pass your location search/autocomplete query to the API in free-text.
callback	[Optional] Use this parameter to specify a JSONP callback function name to wrap your API response in. Learn more about JSONP Callbacks.

API Response:

A successful API request will return one or multiple results that match your search query. In our example, the first array object (London, United Kingdom) contains the correct result. Now that we have our identifying response objects of the target location we were looking for, we can make sure that the correct location is used by other API endpoints by using one of the available location identifiers (ideally: lat and lon) for upcoming queries.

Business Continuity - API Overages
Ensuring our customers achieve success is paramount to what we do at APILayer. For this reason, we will be rolling out our Business Continuity plan guaranteeing your end users will never see a drop in coverage. Every plan has a certain amount of API calls that you can make in the given month. However, we would never want to cut your traffic or impact user experience negatively for your website or application in case you get more traffic.

What is an overage?
An overage occurs when you go over a quota for your API plan. When you reach your API calls limit, we will charge you a small amount for each new API call so we can make sure there will be no disruption in the service we provide to you and your website or application can continue running smoothly.

Prices for additional API calls will vary based on your plan. See table below for prices per call and example of an overage billing.

Plan Name	Monthly Price	Number of Calls	Overage Price per call	Overage	Total price
Standard	$9.99	50,000	0.0002997	10,000	$12.99
Professional	$49.99	300,000	0.00024995	60,000	$64.99
Business	$99.99	1,000,000	0.000149985	200,000	$129.99
Why does APILayer have overage fees?
Overage fees allow developers to continue using an API once a quota limit is reached and give them time to upgrade their plan based on projected future use while ensuring API providers get paid for higher usage.

How do I know if I will be charged for overages?
When you are close to reaching your API calls limit for the month, you will receive an automatic notification (at 75%, 90% and 100% of your monthly quota). However, it is your responsibility to review and monitor for the planâ€™s usage limitations. You are required to keep track of your quota usage to prevent overages. You can do this by tracking the number of API calls you make and checking the dashboard for up-to-date usage statistics.

How will I be charged for my API subscription?
You will be charged for your monthly subscription plan, plus any overage fees applied. Your credit card will be billed after the billing period has ended.

What happens if I donâ€™t have any overage fees?
In this case, there will be no change to your monthly invoice. Only billing cycles that incur overages will see any difference in monthly charges. The Business Continuity plan is an insurance plan to be used only if needed and guarantees your end users never see a drop in coverage from you.

What if I consistently have more API calls than my plan allows?
If your site consistently surpasses the set limits each month, you may face additional charges for the excess usage. Nevertheless, as your monthly usage reaches a certain threshold, it becomes more practical to consider upgrading to the next plan. By doing so, you ensure a smoother and more accommodating experience for your growing customer base.

I would like to upgrade my plan. How can I do that?
You can easily upgrade your plan by going to your Dashboard and selecting the new plan that would be more suitable for your business needs. Additionally, you may contact your Account Manager to discuss a custom plan if you expect a continuous increase in usage.
